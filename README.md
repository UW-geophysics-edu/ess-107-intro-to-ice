## Course Description
The cryosphere is the part of a planet with frozen water. This course covers glaciers, ice sheets, sea ice, icebergs, permafrost, lake ice, and snow on Earth and other planets. Emphasis is placed on human impacts. Course evaluation is based on quantitative assignments with significant coding and quantitative writing components. Background in neither STEM nor coding is required and there will be support for students new to these disciplines.

## Coursework
Evaluation consists of:
- Several equally-weighted Quantitative Assignments, each with several problems (90% of course grade)
- In-class problems submitted using a Classroom Response System (10% of grade)

***The Quantitative Assignments are what makes this course fun.***
- Each Quantitative Assignment will consist of several problems.  A typical problem will involve a student being given a prewritten Jupyter notebook with > 90% of the code already written.  The work to be completed will consist of either small modifications to the code --suitable for students with no coding experience-- or writing brief quantitative descriptions of datasets, methods, or results.
- Quantitative Assignments will be unique to each individual student.  For example, in one assignment each student will analyze a different glacier and no two students will analyze the same glacier.  However, because the same analysis will be performed on every glacier, the work will benefit from working together in groups. 
- Throughout the course, several in-class problems will be assigned and become due during a lecture sesion. To encourage attendance, the dates of the in-class problems won’t be announced ahead of time.

## Grading
- Grades for each problem will be either zero (never handed in), one (complete and bug-free), or ½ (incomplete or buggy). Each assignment may be resubmitted for evaluation as many times as desired within the bounds set by the availability of the teaching staff and the duration of the term.
- Grades will be calculated by rescaling the sum of the grades for all problems (in-person or in the Assignments) to 4.0.  For example, consider a student who attempts all problems but doesn’t complete half of them. Half of their scores would be 0.5 and half would be 1.0.  This student would receive a grade of 3.0.

## Course meetings
Course lectures (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) will focus on presenting new material (Mondays and Wednesdays) and the quantitative assignments (Fridays). Coding studio time will emphasize hands-on work with the quantitative assignments.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand the basic observations and datasets that are the basis for our knowledge of the cryosphere (Quantitative Assignment #1).
2. Be able to explain --using the principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation-- the occurrence, motion, and stability of various aspects of the cryosphere on Earth and other planets (Quantitative Assignment #2).
3. Analyze the dynamics of various components of the cryosphere using simplified statistical (Quantitative Assignment #1), physics-based (Quantitative Assignment #2), and time series techniques (Quantitative Assignment #3).
4. Describe and evaluate cryosphere--societal connections (All Quantitative Assignments).
5. Create extensions to existing computer codes in order to analyze components of the Cryosphere (All Quantitative Assignments).
6. Be able to articulate Open Science principles (All Quantitative Assignments).

## Course Policies
#### Religious Accommodation
Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request Form.

#### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The University of Washington supports an inclusive learning environment where diverse perspectives are recognized, respected, and seen as a source of strength. In this course, I will strive to create welcoming spaces where everyone feels included and engaged regardless of their social and cultural backgrounds.

#### Disability Access and Accommodation
It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law, including establishing reasonable accommodations for all students. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please activate your accommodations via myDRS so that we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course.
If you have not yet established services through DRS, and you have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations, contact DRS directly (disability.uw.edu) to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations.  Conditions requiring accommodation include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts.

#### Academic Integrity
The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable. I expect that you will know and follow university policies regarding all forms of academic and other misconduct.

Acts of academic misconduct include:
Cheating:
unauthorized assistance in person and/or online for assignments, quizzes, tests or exams
using another student’s work without permission and instructor authorization
allowing anyone to take a course, assignment or exam for you without instructor authorization
Falsification: intentional use of falsified data, information or records
Plagiarism: representing the work of others as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original author(s)
Unauthorized collaboration: working with other students in the course on assignments, quizzes or exams without permission
Engaging in behavior prohibited by an instructor
Multiple submissions of the same work in different courses without instructor permission
Deliberately damaging or destroying student work to gain advantage
Unauthorized recording, and/or subsequent dissemination of instructional content

If these definitions are not clear to you, please contact me or your TAs so that we can review them with you.  It is important that you fully understand what is and is not permissible in this course.

Any suspected cases of academic misconduct will be handled according to university regulations. For more information, see the College of the Environment’s Academic Misconduct Policy and the Community Standards and Student Conduct website.

#### Student Academic Grievance Procedures
The College of the Environment Student Academic Grievance Procedures provide mechanisms for enrolled students to address academic problems or grievances in an equitable, respectful and timely manner. Academic grievances are defined as those involving conflicts between a student or students and their course instructors (including faculty and teaching assistants) or research mentor(s) with respect to differences arising within credit-bearing work and while the student is registered at the University of Washington.  If you have or are experiencing such a conflict in this class, and have not, cannot, or do not wish to attempt resolution with me, I encourage you to explore additional options open to you by accessing the website above.

#### Safety
If you feel unsafe or at-risk while taking this or any course, please contact SafeCampus, 206-685-7233 anytime where you can anonymously discuss safety and well-being concerns for yourself or others. SafeCampus can provide individualized support, discuss short- and long-term solutions, and connect you with additional resources when requested.
